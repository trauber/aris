Poor [Ares][] reserve processor's [RIS][] to [AutoHotkey][] converter
in javascript with help from [mustache.js][].


The AutoHotkey template is customized for my workplace.


Aris produces two types of AutoHotkey for RIS with type BOOK or JOUR.
BOOK is for Ares's mongraph template and JOUR for the serial.
